# Newton
An antique program to calculate calculate the zero of a function written with Kick Pascal on Amiga

# Background

I wrote this program back in 1991 for school. It was the only version with full mouse user interface and color display on my [Amiga 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_2000). My classmates stuck on their PC's with monochrome displays and keyboard input.

# Requirements

* Maxon Kick Pascal v2.00 (you may find it somewhere in the internet)
* Amiga 500 or 2000
* Alternatively use [WinUAE](http://www.winuae.net/), [FS UAE](https://fs-uae.net/) or any other Amiga emulator with [Kickstart 1.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_(Amiga)). Get an official ROM with [Amiga Forever](http://www.amigaforever.com/).
